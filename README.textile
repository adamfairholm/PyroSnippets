h1. PyroSnippets 2.0.1

h2. Description

(Formerly PyroChunks, PyroSnippets had a name change in order to not be confused with the new feature of PyroCMS, page chunks. See update instructions below to go from PyroChunks to PyroSnippets.)

h2. Upgrading from PyroChunks

Do you currently have PyroChunks installed and want to switch to PyroSnippets? Good news! Upgrading is easy and your {pyro:chunk:chunk_slug} tags will still work. Just follow the steps below:

* Back up your PyroCMS database (can't be too careful)
* Go into your addons/shared_addons/modules or addons/default/modules folder and delete the chunks folder. *Do not uninstall PyroChunks. Just delete the folder. Uninstalling it will delete your chunks data*.
* Upload the snippets folder into your addons/shared_addons/modules or addons/default/module modules folder.
* Install PyroSnippets from the back end. That should be it!

h2. Regular Installation

To install, add the "snippets" folder to the addons/shared_addons/modules or addons/default/modules folder of your site.

h2. Usage

Create snippets and add the snippet code into your layouts where you'd like them to be. Pretty simple!
