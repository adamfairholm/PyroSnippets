# PyroSnippets 2.4

PyroSnippets allows users to create and manage small snippets of reusable content for their site. Useful for giving clients access to small chunks of content that are not page content and can be edited like text, images, WYSIWYG, and HTML code.

## Installation

If downloading from GitHub, rename the downloaded folder to <var>snippets</var>. Upload the <var>snippets</var> folder to your <var>addons/default/module</var> folder or your <var>addons/shared_addons/modules</var> folder. Install via the Modules section in the admin. 

## Using Snippets

After you install Snippets, it'll show up in the **Content** menu of PyroCMS. There are two areas, "Content" and "Setup". Setup is where you create the snippets and define any parameters. Content is where the snippet content is actually edited.

Once you set a snippet, you can see the syntax to display it in your layouts and themes. It always follows this syntax:

	{{ snippets:your_snippet_slug }}

## Snippet Types

### Text, HTML, and WYSIWYG

Simple text-based snippets that allow you to save text content. In the WYSIWYG snippet, you can choose to use the advanced or simple editor.

### Image

Allows you to upload an image. The tag for the image snippet returns the ID of the file, so you can use it like this:

	{{ files:image id=snippets:your_image_slug width="100" height="100" mode="fill" }}

You can find more info on displaying images in PyroCMS [here](http://docs.pyrocms.com/2.1/manual/plugins/files).
